			<div class=" col-md-12 introduction ">
			<p> Indian are moving out of their country a lot faster than before. There are many article on web giving info on how many Indian are move out in search of better education and work.Wikipedia says 30 million pulse Indian live overseas which is same as the population of Canada.<br> Whether Building the world’s tallest skyscraper in Dubai Burj Khalifa or building googles and FB next software updates you can always find Indian in your team.<br> This article is other way around, This is all about do people around the world like travel to India. I have tried to pull data from <a href="https://data.gov.in/">Digital india initiative</a> to have comprehensive analysis on various visa issued by india embassy to different nationality. </p>
			<p>I would be answering the following question: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Do people travel to india just for tourism, or business or education.</li>
				<li>Did the cricket world cup in 2010 brought more people and boosted tourism in the nation.</li>
				<li>Why does India building  world’s most expensive wall at its border.</li>
			</ol>

				<h2><u>Inference Box</u></h2>
				<ol class="line_chart_text">
					<li>Visa stamping increased to <em>30 times</em> more in 2011 compared to previous year 2010.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The 2011 cricket world cup might have made the buzz as more people from England, Bangladesh and Sri Lankan  come to visit the nation to see there country play the games.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The year 2012 is the peak year as 2.9 million people were issued which highest number of visa is issued so for.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Interestingly almost close to 1 million people from Bangladesh and England were issued. I will keep trying to find any supposing reason why this disproportionality exits.</li>
					</ul>
					<li> The year 2013 saw a <em>12 %</em> drop in visa issuesed with respect to the previouse year 2012.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The reason might be the india was headed to election and growing anti-incumbent to the ruling party led to a large political chaos and protest.</li>

			<div class=" col-md-12 different_visa">
				<p>There are 21 different category of visa type stamped by Indian embassy. The top 5 category [Employment, Tourist, Business, Visitor, Art Surrogacy and Student] add up 90% of total visa approved by the embassy. About 93% of total visa stamped are Tourist visa as in last 4 years close to 6 million people have travel to  visit India for their holidays. As India steps up to global business this can be seen as increase in business trip to India but is this a significant increase, is whole lot of different analysis to do in future. </p>

				<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>During my initial observation I was able to find out that out of 82 country top 10 county contribute 85% of the visa stamped and top 5 [Bangladesh, United Kingdom, America, Germany] contribute to 60% of visa approved. Out of the top 5 country, Bangladesh is odd one and it seems a lot of Bangladesh people has been moving into the country on increasing phrase. During this period there has been number of issues that illegal immigration that cases tension between the nations. These immigration issues where even outspoken by various party during the 2013 election as the problem moves beyond immigration as two nation are dominated by two different religion mainly Hindu and Muslim. This is the reason behind India building world’s most expensive wall to keep people from Bangladesh in control. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTFOQoq0iw">test-tube video</a> has a lot more details if you are interested on world’s most expensive wall.
